## Illustration of friendship network

We'll use `tidygraph` package to create and plot the friendship network from the slides. The nodes are Abby (A), Becca (B), Chloe (C) and Deb (D). Abby is only friends with Becca; Becca is friends with Abby, Chloe and Deb; and Chloe and Deb and friends with Becca and each other (but not Abby).

We'll be relying on this tutorial: [http://users.dimi.uniud.it/~massimo.franceschet/ns/syllabus/make/tidygraph/tidygraph.html](http://users.dimi.uniud.it/~massimo.franceschet/ns/syllabus/make/tidygraph/tidygraph.html)

```{r define-network}


```
